		the conflicting world we live in.\n\
		The sun and moon want to stay\n\
		but they're gone another day.\n\
		\n\
		When the smart exagerate,\n\
		and quiet minds scream,\n\
		an infinite limited time\n\
		to want to run but only dream.\n\
		\n\
		Stars spin and and clouds fly \n\
		through the sky on passing nights.\n\
		Trapped inside an open space,\n\
		a dark world covered in lights.\n\
		\n\
		The busy roads come to a stop, \n\
		and people run void of their hue.\n\
		Life stops in a moving world,\n\
		where crimson intentions turn to blue. \n\
		\n\
		It's a broken contradiction,\n\
		the conflicting world we live in.\n\
		A stillness that won't go away, \n\
		a large price you have to pay. \n\
		\n\
		You need to pause the tape,\n\
		but its already too late.\n\
		The sun sets on the sky,\n\
		but you can't leave the gate.\n\
		Is this destiny just your fate?\n\
		Will the time you're trapped,\n\
		but only just inflate?\n\
		You can only estimate.\n\
		\n\
		It's a conflicting contradiction,\n\
		the broken world that we all live in.\n\
		The essay of unkown never ends,\n\
		the only option is to make amends."

		A day to forget.\n\
		Cursed prelude.\n\
		Confliction renewed.\n\
		\n\
		Ebb and flow tide.\n\
		Soft moonlight's aura.\n\
		Fallen to the side.\n\
		No place to confide.\n\
		\n\
		Mental freedom awoke.\n\
		Silent cacophony.\n\
		Feelings evoke.\n\
		Thoughts choke.\n\
		\n\
		Conlfictions arise,\n\
		Split with moonlight ties.\n\
		A scream to insanity,\n\
		Heard by no one to see."
